# SurfReport

What's hanging?  Just cruising over here. This is a totally wicked program that will tell you which pipe you should hit!

## Installation


You can install this gem via `gem install surf_report`. The `surf_report` CLI will be installed and you can run `surf_report` to get a list of the waves you can hit now right in your command line.


## Usage

Run: `surf_report` after installing the gem.
The 3 day surf forecast will come up first.  You can then type 1, 2, or 3 for a more detailed report for that day. Pretty simple.  

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

To run the development version of the CLI run `bundle exec bin/surf_report`
